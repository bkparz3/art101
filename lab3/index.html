			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures and Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Thhis lab was mainly geared toward getting everyone organized with their files and understanding how to create files. As well as adding images.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I kept running into an issue with uploading an image to my repo. I have no idea what the issue was but I cropped the image and that seemed to fix the problem... </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall I think this was a good experience. This lab showed me how technical this process is and that very slight and simple issues can mess up everything. My files are organized now though. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I completed this lab and resolved my issues. My website is beginning to take form.</p>
